This project is hardcoded and no copy-pasted code from any resources.

Libraries used:
1. express - for building api services
2. mysql2 - for mysql connection
3. dotenv - for env properties
4. nodemon - to refresh/hot reload

For improvement: 
1. error handling
2. use ORM such as sequelize, prisma
3. remove redundant code by introducing reusable function

Steps to run the crud api service
1. Setup your mysql configuration
2. Put your mysql credentials in .env
3. Run all the mysql scripts under migrations/db
4. Run the command line: npm run start

That's it! You got it!
